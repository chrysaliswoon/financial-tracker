# Personal Financial Tracker

## Project Brief
### Technical Requirements

- Use MongoDB, Express, React and Node
- Have at least 2 related models (with references) and an additional user model with authentication. There should be at least 2 types of users.
- Include all major CRUD functions for at least one of the models
- Manage team contributions and collaboration by using standard Git flow on Github.
- Nicely styled front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS, with or without a framework.
- Deploy your application online, so that it is publically accessible
- User stories that apply to the functionality of your app, crafted as a team.
- Wireframes for the views you planned to create

### Final Deliverables

- A **working app, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
- A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project.
- **A `readme.md` file** with:
  - Explanations of the **technologies** used
  - A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
  - **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
  - Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
  - Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
  - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome
- A `presentation.md` of "slides" that walk through a demo of your app.

## Description

INSERT PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### Technical Used
For this project, we used the following technologies:

```
- React: CRA
- Bootstrap with React
- MongoDB
- Express
- Postman
- Storybook
- Jest
- Figma
- Github Desktop
```

### Wireframes

For our wireframe, we used Figma to create an initial skeleton of what the project will look like, and identify the necessary component and files:

## Planning and Development Process

We had approximately 3 weeks from ideation to creation to develop a fullstack application. Below is a rough estimation of how we had broken down our task lists:

**Week 1**

1. Set up the Github Repository using the template given in the project page

2. Brainstorm for ideas in Figma

3. Set up the project files and installed the necessary dependencies

**Week 2**

1.

**Week 3**

1. 

### Problem-Solving Strategy

In order to have clarity on what was required to create the project, our first priority was creating a wireframe and a working prototype to have a visual of how everything would flow. By creating a wireframe, it also allowed us to see what components and pages we would need to create our project, and delegate the tasks.
